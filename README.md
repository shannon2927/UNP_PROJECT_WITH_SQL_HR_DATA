# UNP_PROJECT_WITH_SQL_HR_DATA

While interning at United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), I was assigned an SQL project based on an HR dataset to extract useful insights for business analysis. I started by preprocessing the dataâ€”de-duplication, fixing data types, and creating relationships among important tables like Employees, Departments, and Jobs. I crafted optimized SQL queries to examine key HR metrics such as average salary by department, employee breakdown by job role, and recent hiring patterns. This endeavor further informed my knowledge of data cleaning, relational database management, and SQL-driven workforce analysis, with all scripts posted on GitHub for reference and expansion
